# Nicholas Robinson - Portfolio

I am an enthusiastic career driven young man, eager to broaden and strengthen my software engineering knowledge and skills.  I thrive on solving problems by applying abstract, analytical and logical thinking.  I enjoy honing my skills by doing coding katas, not dissimilar to the Foobar problems I have been doing. 

When I am not working, I am a light aircraft pilot and I enjoy traveling, meeting new people and learning about different cultures. I also enjoy working with microcontrollers like Adriano.
